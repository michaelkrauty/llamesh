# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.0.2] - 2026-03-31

### Fixed

- Cookbook hot-reload now wakes queued requests. Previously, when a model's
  resource estimate exceeded `max_vram_mb`, the request was queued with
  `insufficient_resources` and subsequent requests piled up behind it for
  fairness. If a cookbook reload reduced the resource requirements (e.g. by
  lowering context length), the queued requests were never re-evaluated,
  permanently jamming the queue until restart.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-03-26

### Fixed

- Nodes no longer stop serving requests during llama.cpp rebuilds. Builds use
  isolated per-commit directories; the existing binary symlink remains valid
  throughout, so `can_serve()` now depends only on binary existence, not the
  build flag.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-03-19

Initial public release.

### Added

- **OpenAI-compatible API** — `/v1/chat/completions`, `/v1/completions`, `/v1/embeddings`, `/v1/models` endpoints
- **Automatic instance management** — on-demand `llama-server` spawn, health monitoring, and idle eviction
- **Multi-node mesh clustering** — zero-config LAN discovery via mDNS or explicit WAN peer configuration
- **Noise Protocol encryption** — authenticated, encrypted inter-node communication
- **Model profiles** — multiple profiles per model with different `llama-server` args (e.g. `fast` vs `quality`)
- **Resource guardrails** — VRAM and system memory tracking to prevent OOM
- **Hot-reload cookbook** — add or modify models without restarting the proxy
- **Auto-build llama.cpp** — clones, builds, smoke tests, and atomically swaps binaries
- **Hugging Face integration** — automatic model downloads via `hf_repo`/`hf_file`
- **SSE streaming** — streaming with backpressure, forwarded verbatim from llama-server
- **Circuit breaker** — automatic peer failure detection and recovery
- **Slot-aware routing** — routes requests to the instance with the most available slots
- **Request queueing** — queues requests when all slots are busy, with configurable timeouts
- **TLS/mTLS support** — optional TLS termination and mutual TLS for clients
- **API key authentication** — configurable API key validation for client requests
- **Prometheus metrics** — `/metrics` endpoint plus JSON snapshots at `/metrics/json`
- **Health probes** — `/healthz` and `/readyz` for load balancer and orchestrator integration
- **Log analysis tooling** — scripts for error triage, request tracing, instance lifecycle, and cluster health
- **Systemd deployment** — install script and service template
